        <p>Text Analysis</p>  
        <p>For this assignments I analyzed two phenomenal books, <i>Animal Farm</i> by George Orwell and <i>Lord
           of the Flies</i> written by William Golding and compared interesting features between one another.</p>  
        <p>In this project I used digital tools like Voyant and AntConc to help me get a deeper view of these 
           books most repeated words and N-Grams to grasp a better understanding of them. </p>

               <div class="introduction">                 
                   <p>The reason I chose to analyse and compare these two books is because they are very similar 
                       and different at the same time. What I mean with this is that the two books share a deep 
                       metaphorical message telling the story of the behaviour of a group of characters and how 
                       they interact with each other, but they do it  in very different styles. Even without reading 
                       the books, thanks to the use of AntConc we can tell how characters in both books deal with 
                       rules set by themselves and all the controversies these create. </p>

                            <p>Let’s take a look at <i>Lord of the Flies </i>first, we see the word “Conch”  as a symbol 
                                of order and respect, the one that has the conch has the word. But the more we move 
                                forward in the story we see how they start fighting, questioning and changing that 
                                rule that was keeping them civil. And something very similar applies to <i>Animal Farm.
                                </i> The animals set a phrase to help them separate good from evil, “four legs good, two 
                                legs bad”. But right at the bottom of the picture AntConc shows us how the phrase 
                                transforms into “four legs good, two legs better!”. Basically, they ended up becoming
                                the same thing they were told to hate.</p>

                            <p>A contrast I really like about these two masterpieces is how animals are seen by the 
                                characters in the story. In one they are the heroes and protagonists, and in the other 
                                as beasts and as an insult.</p>

                            <p>Although the correlation is not perfect, the graphics are pretty similar between 
                                the words “throat” and “beast” in <i>Lord of the Flies</i> and “hero” and “animal” in 
                                <i>Animal Farm</i>. Voyant does an amazing job helping us visualize words' appearances 
                                and consistency throughout the story. The graphs are both fantastic representations of 
                                the contrast that the two stories have towards animals and the roles they play.</p>

                        <div class="fourth-analysis">
                            <p>Another very interesting point to compare in these books, are the main characters and 
                                how they are perceived by the rest of the characters. In one we have <i>Napoleon</i>, 
                                a leader and an authority to the other animals, and in the other we have <i>Ralph</i>, a 
                                character who started as the leader but his authority vanishes throughout the story. 
                                The way the other characters talk about them and to them says a lot of their actual 
                                role in the story. Thankfully we have AntConc and Voyant to see the contrast.</p>

                     <div class="fifth-analysis">
                         <p>Again, even though the correlation between “hero”, “right” and “Napoleon'' is not 
                             perfect we can see similarities in the curves. On the other hand when we look at 
                             “Ralph” and the word “right”, the results are very inconsistent and the correlation 
                             is practically nonexistent. Both books narrate very different leadership stories and 
                             the words that come along with these leaders' names, are a great way to tell.</p>

                    <div class="sixth-analysis">
                        <p>Lastly I would like to compare the settings where the stories take place. The way the 
                            characters perceive the setting says a lot about their well-being and behaviours. For 
                            example, if we see the word “farm” and phrases related to it, they are mostly positive, 
                            meaning that the animals are comfortable and happy where they are. But if we check 
                            “island” in Lord of the Flies, the contexts where this word appears are mostly negative, 
                            suggesting that the boys are struggling to survive.</p>

                  <div class="seventh-analysis">
                      <p>Not only does AntConc show us these results, but if we plug “farm” and “good” in Voyant 
                          we can see a strong correlation. However, when type “island” and “death” for example we 
                          can also see that the graphs are correlated.</p>
