                <p>Text Analysis</p>
                <p>For this assignments I analyzed two phenomenal books, <i>Animal Farm</i> by
                    George Orwell and <i>Lord of the Flies</i> written by William Golding and
                    compared interesting features between one another.</p>
                <p>In this project I used digital tools like Voyant and AntConc to help me get a
                    deeper view of these books most repeated words and N-Grams to grasp a better
                    understanding of them. </p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>The reason I chose to analyse and compare these two books is because they are
                    very similar and different at the same time. What I mean with this is that the
                    two books share a deep metaphorical message telling the story of the behaviour
                    of a group of characters and how they interact with each other, but they do it
                    in very different styles. Even without reading the books, thanks to the use of
                    AntConc we can tell how characters in both books deal with rules set by
                    themselves and all the controversies these create. </p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Let’s take a look at <i>Lord of the Flies </i>first, we see the word “Conch” as a
                    symbol of order and respect, the one that has the conch has the word. But the
                    more we move forward in the story we see how they start fighting, questioning
                    and changing that rule that was keeping them civil. And something very similar
                    applies to <i>Animal Farm. </i> The animals set a phrase to help them separate
                    good from evil, “four legs good, two legs bad”. But right at the bottom of the
                    picture AntConc shows us how the phrase transforms into “four legs good, two
                    legs better!”. Basically, they ended up becoming the same thing they were told
                    to hate.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>A contrast I really like about these two masterpieces is how animals are seen by
                    the characters in the story. In one they are the heroes and protagonists, and in
                    the other as beasts and as an insult.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Although the correlation is not perfect, the graphics are pretty similar between
                    the words “throat” and “beast” in <i>Lord of the Flies</i> and “hero” and
                    “animal” in <i>Animal Farm</i>. Voyant does an amazing job helping us visualize
                    words' appearances and consistency throughout the story. The graphs are both
                    fantastic representations of the contrast that the two stories have towards
                    animals and the roles they play.</p>
            </div>
            
                <hr/>
            
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Another very interesting point to compare in these books, are the main characters
                    and how they are perceived by the rest of the characters. In one we have
                        <i>Napoleon</i>, a leader and an authority to the other animals, and in the
                    other we have <i>Ralph</i>, a character who started as the leader but his
                    authority vanishes throughout the story. The way the other characters talk about
                    them and to them says a lot of their actual role in the story. Thankfully we
                    have AntConc and Voyant to see the contrast.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Again, even though the correlation between “hero”, “right” and “Napoleon'' is not
                    perfect we can see similarities in the curves. On the other hand when we look at
                    “Ralph” and the word “right”, the results are very inconsistent and the
                    correlation is practically nonexistent. Both books narrate very different
                    leadership stories and the words that come along with these leaders' names, are
                    a great way to tell.</p>

                <hr />
            
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Lastly I would like to compare the settings where the stories take place. The way
                    the characters perceive the setting says a lot about their well-being and
                    behaviours. For example, if we see the word “farm” and phrases related to it,
                    they are mostly positive, meaning that the animals are comfortable and happy
                    where they are. But if we check “island” in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, the
                    contexts where this word appears are mostly negative, suggesting that the boys
                    are struggling to survive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pictures">
                <figure>
                    <img src="Screenshots/island.png" alt="island"/>

                </figure>
            </div>
           
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>Not only does AntConc show us these results, but if we plug “farm” and “good” in
                    Voyant we can see a strong correlation. Something similar happens, when type
                    “island” and “death” for example, we can also see that the graphs are
                    correlated. Once again, the relationship between some words is indicating very
                    interesting features about the books settings, characters and dialogs.</p>

                <p>This type of project is clear example of how many differences and contrasts you
                    can find between two books that are pretty similar in terms of themes and
                    metaphorical background. Like I said at the beginning, the styles in which both
                    stories are narrated is what makes each one unique and memorable. And the best
                    way to see these books in depth is with text analysis tools like AntCon and
                    Voyant.</p>
