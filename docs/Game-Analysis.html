            <p>The gameplay is very simple throughout the game. The movements are forward, backwards, left and right and you can either click with the mouse where you want to go or
            use the arrows at the bottom right of the keyboard. To move forward in conversations or character interactions you can press the space bar or enter. Selecting options is also 
            pretty easy, you can click on them or just move with the arrows through the options and press enter when you choose it.</p>

        <div class="game">
            <p>The graphics in vanish are what is known as <b>2D sprite tile-based graphical style</b>, which I think are a great choice for these type of games. Other exploration-adventure
               games such as Terraria also have these graphics because it makes the map easy to understand. Every asset, NPC or room in Vanish is well designed, there are a lot of colors 
               that make the game more appealing. </p>

                <p>The videogame includes an original, unique soundtrack that is probably one of the best features. Since the moment you open it a misterious and scary music 
                   starts playing and immediately immerse yourself in the game. Everytime you go through a door or something unexpected is happening, like an alarm going off or the floor
                   breaking there is a specific noise in the background. "The Flock" has an actual voice, that seems to be modified digitally to give a more dramatic effect. Click on each
                   one to listen to them.</p>

                        <li><a class="game-options"><b>- Chapter 2:</b> The second chapter is more about actually leaving the "prison" and finding a way to do it with character Number 3.

                     <p> Another great attribute Vanish includes, are interactions with objects around the game. Your character can comment on practically everything he finds, from a toilet,
                         to a book and even to a painting. Some are just nonesense, but some include hidden clues. In regards to the NPC's, the characters you interact with in the game, 
                         are very realistic in a way that they react according to what you ask and do. Their dialogs are very connected to the context of the story and really makes the
                         the game captivating.</p>

               <h2>Overall Review:</h2>
           </div>        
               <div class="game">
                   <p> Although as simple as the game appears to be, it has an excellent and engaging story with very interesting characters. The map is big enough to feel like you are
                       always exploring without loosing sense of where you need to go. The puzzles and minigames put a challenge to the game that really makes you stop for a moment and 
                       take your time solving them. There are plot twists and surpises throughout the story which makes those 30 minutes of gameplay feel like much more. The only thing that 
                       I would add is a little more inforation at the end of what the place is to help you understand the whole videogame better. But as far as the music, graphics, gameplay 
                       and story goes, Vanish is a very enjoyable game. </p>
