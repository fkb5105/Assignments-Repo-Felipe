                               State University, also minoring in Media Production and Data Visualization. I was born in Argentina but also lived in countries 
                               like Germany and Mexico, and currently looking for new opportunities and challenges in the U.S</p>
                           <p id="mywork">I am a sports enthusiast, I enjoy watching and analyzing almost every single sport, from Formula 1 to the NFL to the PGA Tour. And
                              I'm always trying to translate the passion that sports give me into everything I do. </p>
